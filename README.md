# Synect - Eurorack Module for connecting Modular Synthesizers with WIFI + Ethernet
## Disclamer: This project is still in progress. We will publish and inform you when it is ready to use.
The goal of this project is to build a eurorack module, which can connect modular synthesizers via WIFI or Ethernet. The module will have some input and output audio jacks, as well as a WIFI module and a Ethernet port.
We will use a WT32-ETH01 MCU as the core, as well as WM8731 audio codec chips.
### What will be next
Currently we are designing breakout boards for the WM8731 and the WT32-ETH01 for testing purposes. We will update this info when they are ready to use.
